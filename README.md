# DevOps-Basics
Comprises Theoretical notes for understanding DevOps
**DevOps:** DevOps means automating the process of code build, testing and deployment.
      -It improves the organization ability to deliver application
      -DevOps follows Continuous Integration & Continuous (Delivery or Deployment) [CI / CD]
      -DevOps is improving the 1.**AUTOMATION** in proper Place
                               2.**QUALITY** maintenance of app
                               3.Continuous **MONITORING /OBERSERVABILITY**
                               4.Continuous **TESTING**
      -**PILLARS OF DEVOPS :automation,quality,Monitor,Testing.**

                                                --Defining
                                                --Designing
                                                --Build/Develop -------------------
                                                --Testing       --- DEVOPS WORK IN THESE PRIMARILY
                                                --Deploy        -------------------
PROCESS OCCURING IN THESE PHAES:
                      1.Devlopers **DEVELOP/BUILD** and PUSH the **SOURCE CODE** to GIT/ other **VCS[VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM]**
                      2.**QUALITY ENGINEERS** will **UPLOADCODE** to **SERVER** and will **TEST** the **CODE**
                      3.CODE is **UPLOADED** to **PRODUCTION SERVER** for **DEPLOYMENT** if it **PASSES THE TESTING**,thus **AVAILABLE to CUSTOMERS**
   -----------DEVOPS ENGINEER WILL MAKE SURE THESE OPERATIONS ARE DONE QUICKLY BY AUTOMATING EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT ANY MANUAL INTERVENTION------

AGILE METHDOLOGY:----WORK is DONE in CHUNKS as soon as PLANNING for a CERTAIN CHUNK is DONE , RATHER THAN WAITING FOR ENTIRE PLANNING TO BE READY TO BUILD ,they will BUILD in CHUNKS ,by BUILDING a CHUNK ,they MOVE  to other CHUNK OF WORK.[VAGUE DEFINITON].

**---CI/CD:---**
              **-CONTINUOUS INTERATION & CONTINOUS DEPLOYMENT**---DEPLY TO CUSTOMER OVER  A PLATFORM

                  INTGRATE SET OF TOOLS/PROCESSES TO WORK BEFORE DELIVERY

**--PROCESS/TESTING BEFORE DELIVERY:**
                    **1.UNIT TESTING:**: testing EACH AND EVERY UNIT SEPARATELY for PROPER FUNCTIONALITY.
                    **2.STATIC CODE ANALYSIS**: CHECK for SYNTAX &  SEMANTICS so that there wont be any UNUSED MEMORY or other USELESS ELEMENTS
                    **3.CODE QUALITY/BULNERABILITY TESTING**:before PROMOTING app to NEXT STAGE ,CHECK for QUALITY and VULNERABILITES IN IT
                    **4.AUTOMATIONN/FUNCTIONALITY/END TO END TESTING**: CODE is TESTED for FUNCTIONALITY of each MODULE or UNIT COMBINELY or CHECKING if one FUNCTIONALITY dont AFFECT other MODULES/UNIT.
                    **5.REPORTS**:REPORTS regarding EACH TESTS and CODE QUALITY must be CREATED to ensure QUALITY OF APP OR CODE.
                    **6.DEPLOY:**:MAKE CODE AVAILABALE TO CUSTOMER .
